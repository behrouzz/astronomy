"""
When astronomers observe a distant galaxy, they ask :
 - "How far away is that galaxy?"
 - "How long has the light from that galaxy been traveling?"

We can answer the first question by computing the proper distance dp(t0).
We can answer the second question by computing the lookback time.

"lookback time" = t0 - te
---------------
If light emitted at time te is observed at time t0, the lookback time is
simply t0 âˆ’ te.

Both depend on the model universe.
